Hospitality DataSet Tableau Book Key Metrics Documentation
Background and Purpose
The dataset represents financial and operational metrics of properties across various brands, countries, and years. The goal is to derive insights into profitability, efficiency, and market trends by calculating and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs provide actionable insights for decision-makers to optimize operations, identify growth opportunities, and improve revenue strategies.
Dashboard Overview
The final dashboard tells a comprehensive story about property performance, focusing on the following key insights:
KPI-1: Gross Operating Profit by Year, Brand, and Country


Visualizes the yearly trends in gross operating profit, broken down by brand and geographical location.
KPI-2: Choose Gross KPI (EBITDA, Gross Operating Income, Gross Operating Profit, Net Operating Income)


Allows users to explore specific profitability metrics by brand, country, ,and year.
Additional Insights:


RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and , (Occupancy Rate): Metrics highlighting room revenue performance.
Market Share: Compares brand performance within regions.
Maps for Total Revenue by Brand Name: Geospatial representation of revenue distribution.
These insights enable stakeholders to evaluate financial health, optimize room pricing, and understand market dynamics.

Key Metrics and Their Descriptions
1. Total Departmental Expenses

Measures revenue generated per available room, combining occupancy and ADR.

Dataset Columns and Usage in the Dashboard
The following columns from the original dataset provide the foundation for calculating and displaying the KPIs:
Acquisition Date: Tracks when the property was acquired.
Brand: Differentiates metrics by brand for comparison.
City, State, Country: Geographic details for regional analysis.
Date: Time dimension for trends and periodic analysis.
Dimension: Defines the scope of metrics (e.g., property-wide or departmental).
Labels: Identifies corresponding KPI labels (e.g., EBITDA Label, Gross Operating Income Label).
Measure Type: Specifies the type of metric being recorded.
Indicator - Display Value: Provides user-friendly display names for indicators.
Measure Value: Holds the numerical value for each KPI.

How the Dashboard Brings These Metrics Together

Formulas are applied to derive metrics like ADR, RevPAR, EBITDA, and others from raw dataset columns.
2. Visualization Techniques
Key metrics are presented using:
Bar Charts: For comparing revenues and expenses across properties or time.
Line Charts: For tracking trends like occupancy and RevPAR.
Heatmaps: To highlight high-performing locations or periods.
3. Interactivity
Users can filter by date, brand, location, or other dimensions.
Dynamic labels and calculated fields update instantly based on user inputs.
4. Performance Insights
Metrics like Gross Operating Profit %, Net Operating Income %, and RevPAR provide actionable insights into operational efficiency.
Occupancy and ADR trends help optimize room pricing strategies.
5. User-Friendly Design
The dashboard is structured for easy interpretation by both finance experts and non-experts.
Definitions and formulas are embedded as tooltips for clarity.

By combining detailed KPIs, dynamic visualizations, and interactivity, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and optimize property performance effectively.
